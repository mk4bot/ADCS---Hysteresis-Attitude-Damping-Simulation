# ADCS---Hysteresis-Attitude-Damping-Simulation

Working progress on a simulation of a 3U cubesat using magnetic hysteresis as a detumble mechanism. See the code for the simulation! This simulation will eventually be used to verify hysteresis rod sizing and verify body rate requirements for multiple flying CubeSats in the future!
